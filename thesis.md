      <p>Classification of Finite Groups of Orders 1-20. Bachelor's thesis, School of Science, Aalto University; April, 2025.</p>
      
      <p>The thesis presents a comprehensive classification of finite groups of orders 1-20 (except order 16), examining their structure through the Sylow theorems and other fundamental group-theoretic results. The work stems from basic principles to powerful classification tools, demonstrating how the prime factorization of a group's order relates to its structure and the number of possible isomorphism classes.</p>
      
      <p>The thesis explores how symmetry is mathematically modelled through group theory. It provides a self-contained and accessible account of small groups, analyzing both Abelian and non-Abelian structures while developing the necessary theory of subgroups, cosets, direct and semidirect products.</p>
