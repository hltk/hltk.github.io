  <h2>About Henrik Aalto</h2>

  <section class="about-section">
    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>I hold a BSc in Mathematics from Aalto University with a minor in Computer Science. I competed in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and the Baltic Olympiad in Informatics (BOI), earning medals in both.</p>
      
      <p>Today I lead the Machine Learning team at Hamina Wireless, where I build and ship computer-vision solutions. Before that, I wrote RF physics simulation components and graphics engines here at Hamina.</p>
      
      <p>I've published research on algorithmic efficiency in social-network influence and wrote my thesis on classifying finite groups. In my free time I volunteer as a coach for Finland's IOI Training Program.</p>
